Problem statement 1:

You need to create text editorwhere we need to type 1000's of letters.

- Parameters of Letter are font, size , x coordinate and y coordinate
- Here font is fixed - Times New Roman
- Size is same for all letters - 10
- x and y coordinates are different for all robots.

-Here font and size are intrinsic objects means data can be shared among objects ( Here all letters )
- x,y coordinates are extrinsic objects means data is different for all objects.

- Flyweight design pattern helps to solve this. It is structural design pattern
- We can group all Intrinsic objects in 1 class (Here font and size)
- For Extrinsic objects create interface and pass these items as a method parameter.
- Create 1 factory class to create objects.
- So in factory we'll create 1 hashmap of type - Character, InterfaceLetter
- We'll first check if object is already present is map if yes return, if not create new and put in map.
- With the help of object we will render object on screen by passing x and y coordinates.
- So at max only 26 objects will be created for 1000's of letters.

THIS IS HOW MEMORY WILL BE REDUCED

- Flyweight can be used when 
* Memory limitation is there
* We need to share data among objects
* Object creation is heavy
